# StegoLock Comprehensive Testing Guideline
Generated: April 29, 2026
Last Updated: May 03, 2026 (Verified UI-01, UI-02 as ✅ PASSED per `docs/test-results.md`)

## RBAC Implementation Analysis (May 03, 2026)
Based on code review of `app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php`, `app/Models/User.php`, and `routes/web.php`:
1. **Role Definitions**: Properly defined (user, user_admin, db_storage_admin, superadmin) with helper methods in User model.
2. **RoleMiddleware**: Correctly validates user roles, redirects unauthenticated users, aborts 403 for unauthorized roles.
3. **Route Protection Gaps**:
   - `/admin/dashboard` (ADM-01) only requires `auth` + `verified`, not role checks. Standard users can access this route (violates ERR-05).
   - `/admin/users` (ADM-02 related) lacks role middleware; controller partially mitigates by filtering users for non-superadmins.
   - Sub-routes for cloud/database management and superadmin actions correctly use role middleware.
4. **Controller Checks**: Inconsistent role checks across admin controllers; some rely on controller logic instead of middleware.

This document provides an exhaustive suite of test scenarios to verify the functionality, security, and integrity of the StegoLock system across all user roles.

## 2. Standard User: Document Management
Focuses on the lifecycle of files and folders within the personal workspace.

| ID | Feature | Role | Test Steps | Expected Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| DM-01 | **New Folder** | User | Click "New" -> "New Folder"; enter a name. | Folder appears in the grid; breadcrumbs update on entry. | ✅ PASSED |
| DM-02 | **Rename Action** | User | File Menu -> Rename; provide new name. | Database updates; UI reflects new filename immediately. | ✅ PASSED |

## 3. Core Security: The Stegano Pipeline
Focuses on the high-security "Locking" and "Unlocking" engines.

| ID | Feature | Role | Test Steps | Expected Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-01| **Locking (Upload)** | User | Click "New" -> "Lock a File"; select a document. | Card shows "Locking" shimmer; status cycles to "Stored". | Pending |
| SEC-02| **Unlocking (Recon)** | User | File Menu -> "Unlock File". | Card shows "Puzzle" animation; background reassembly starts. | Pending |
| SEC-03| **Download Ready** | User | Wait for unlock completion. | `DownloadReadyModal` pops up automatically. | Pending |
| SEC-04| **Integrity Check** | User | Unlock and download a sensitive PDF. | File opens correctly; hash matches the original (no corruption). | Pending |
| SEC-05| **Multiple Shards** | User | Upload a 5MB+ file. | System correctly splits file across >3 covers (verify via Info). | Pending |
| SEC-06| **Process Mutex** | User | Attempt to unlock a file while another is locking. | System handles concurrent background jobs without collision. | Pending |

## 4. Collaboration & Sharing
Focuses on secure access control between users.

| ID | Feature | Role | Test Steps | Expected Result | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| COL-01| **Generate Share** | User | File Menu -> "Share"; enter recipient email. | Share record created; recipient receives notification. | Pending |
| COL-02| **Accept Share** | User | Navigate to "Shared With Me"; click Accept. | File appears in recipient's workspace with a "Shared" badge. | Pending |
| COL-03| **Revoke Access** | Owner| Shared Page -> "Manage Access" -> Remove User. | Recipient immediately loses access; file disappears from their UI. | Pending |
| COL-04| **Unlock Shared** | Recipient| Unlock a file shared by another user. | Retrieval and extraction work using the owner's stego-maps. | Pending |
